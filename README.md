# 2023-group-33-project

## TODO before deadline
- A link to deployed/running app. You can deploy the app on HerokuLinks to an external site., FirebaseLinks to an external site., or any other server that anybody can easily access when doing the review. Setup this as soon as possible as it takes time and if you start just before the deadline you might be late.

- A link to your git repository

- A README file (in English) in your Git repository detailing:

- Short description of your project

- What you have done

- What you still plan to do

- Your project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)

### Your projects are naturally at various stages of completeness, but the minimum we expect that you have by deadline is:


- that you have setup the basic framework code (e.g. the skeleton)

- have initial layout of your app

- showing the data from at least one API call
